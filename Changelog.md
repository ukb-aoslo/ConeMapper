### 17.03.2021
 - Improve usability of "Corrected Cone Locs2".
 - Add script to calculate brightness statistics of cone locations(/Utilities/get_brightness_stats_all_files.m).
 - Add restriction by pixel brightness in correction algorithm. 
   If pixel brightness less than threshold value, than this point will not be consider as potential cone location.
