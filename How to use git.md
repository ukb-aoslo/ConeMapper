# How to use git
  - By the command line. Basic commands you can find here: https://dzone.com/articles/top-20-git-commands-with-examples
  - By the GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/
  - Unfortunately, Git in matlab does not work (i cannot fetch updates from remote repository or push to it). It is usable only in case to watch changes: RMC on file -> Source Control -> Compare to Ancestor.

## GitHub Desktop
  - First of all sign in: File -> Options -> Accounts -> Sign in. Use your github account.
  - Second: clone the repository. File -> Clone Repository. We need to find `ukb-aoslo/ConeFinderApp`
  - Now if you want to download the updates then click "Fetch origin".
  - If you want to push your updates you should write short message in small line above "commit button". Press "commit" and then press Push to origin.
