%% Cone recognotion
%% Recognition
% To start a new recognition of the cones you need to click _File -> New recognition_.
% 
% Then you will get a few options to choose:
%% 
% * Fast Peak Find - finds cones as the local maximum
% * CNN - finds cones by pretrained neural network (Cunefare)
% * Import from CSV - imports locations from CSV file as it is.
%% 
% If you choose "CNN", then app will ask you what pretrained set to use and 
% after that the recognition process will start.
% 
% If you choose "Import from CSV", then app will ask you to select the CSV file 
% with the data.
% 
% *Important!* CNN should be compiled before use.
%% Post prosessing
% As a post prosessing steps you can:
%% 
% * Delete cones outside of the image - this is based on image properties: All 
% retinal images should have black surrounding. Deletes all cones which is placed 
% on black pixels.
% * Delete double cones - deletes all cones with the distance to neighbor cones 
% less than 2.5 pixels. The minimum distance between cones among 41 eye, annotated 
% by JLR is 2.6874. Distance 2.5 is choosen in order to have "safe zone".
%% 
% Also user can add(Alt+Left mouse button) or delete(Alt+Right mouse button) 
% cones manually by clicking on the image. Besides it is possible to delete multiple 
% cones in selected polygon by _Delete Selected Cones_ function, or use Fast Peak 
% Find in selected rectangular area additionaly.
