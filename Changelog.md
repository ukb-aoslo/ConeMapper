 - Fixed bug with empty strips after recognition.

### 27.07.2021
 - Fixed bug with not working Voronoi diagram in EditMode.

### 17.03.2021
 - Improve usability of "Corrected Cone Locs2".
 - Add script to calculate brightness statistics of cone locations(/Utilities/get_brightness_stats_all_files.m).
